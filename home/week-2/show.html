<h3>Lecture: <a href="../lectures/hypertext-markup-language">HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</a></h3>
<p>HTML is the foundation of the web. It is the language that describes the structure of a web page. You already know some of it!</p>
<h3>Activity: Web Typography</h3>
<p>Choose a text (at least 1,000 words) and create a webpage for it (this will be in your repository in<code>/lab/week-2/index.html</code>). Use properly formatted markup to create the structure of your webpage (headings go in <code>h1</code> tags, paragraphs go in <code>p</code> tags, quotes go in <code>blockquote</code> tags, etc.). Consider typography hierarchy (within the defaults of HTML) and the meaning of the text and how this is reflected in the typography.</p>
