### Demo

Add a question to [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H-i3QBcz8mL1CyXkg15WKix49rTq63EoXoBsO8Nvq9I/edit?usp=sharing) and I'll pick some things to demo!

Go ahead and bookmark this – we will use it at the beginning of most classes.

### Lecture: [HyperText Markup Language (HTML)](../lectures/hypertext-markup-language)

HTML is the foundation of the web. It is the language that describes the structure of a web page. You already know some of it!

### Activity: Web Typography

Choose a text (at least 1,000 words) and create a webpage for it (this will be in your repository in`/lab/week-2/index.html`). Use properly formatted markup to create the structure of your webpage (headings go in `h1` tags, paragraphs go in `p` tags, quotes go in `blockquote` tags, etc.). Consider typography hierarchy (within the defaults of HTML) and the meaning of the text and how this is reflected in the typography.
