# Core 2 Interaction: Lab

## Friday, Februrary 9

Sorry to miss this week! We will have a make-up at the end of the semester.

### Lecture: [Intro to CSS](https://jackrieger.com/teaching/core-1-interaction/lectures/intro-to-css/)

### Assignment: Web Typography (continued)

We made the HTML for this assignment during the last class. Now you will be augmenting it with CSS, and submitting it as an assignment.

Web Typography (from last class)
- Choose a text (at least 1,000 words; don't spend too much time on this) and create a webpage for it (this will be in your repository in /lab/week-2/index.html)
- Use properly formatted markup to create the structure of your webpage (headings go in <h1>, <h2> tags, paragraphs go in <p> tags, quotes go in <blockquote> tags, etc.)

New additions
- If there are no images in the original text, add at least three images to enhance the page.
- Use CSS to style your page
  - Change the default font
  - Use at least three different type sizes
  - The page cannot have any of the same styles as the default HTML stylesheet, e.g. no Times New Roman, no white background, no default margins, etc.
    - For reference, this is a default, unstyled page: 
- Consider typography hierarchy and the meaning of the text and how this is reflected in the typography
