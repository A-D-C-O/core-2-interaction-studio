Web Typography
- Choose a text (at least 1,000 words; don't spend too much time on this) and create a webpage for it (this will be in your repository in /lab/week-2/index.html)
- Use properly formatted markup to create the structure of your webpage (headings go in <h1>, <h2> tags, paragraphs go in <p> tags, quotes go in <blockquote> tags, etc.)
- If there are no images in the original text, add at least three images to enhance the page.
- Use CSS to style the type in your page, making sure to use a custom font
- Consider typography hierarchy and the meaning of the text and how this is reflected in the typography

Embedded content
- What does it mean to embed content from another website into your own site?
- Use the HTML embed code of at least 3 different online services within a single webpage to create a mashup of services that together portray a singular idea
- e.g. how can audio from Spotify or Soundcloud be used to give new meaning to a silent movie clip from YouTube
